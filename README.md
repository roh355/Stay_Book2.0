# StayBook

A room-booking demo with two modes:

- **Conferences** — book Skyline Conference Center rooms by half-hour slots (08:00–20:00).
- **Hostels** — book Skyline Residences by night across a 60-day horizon.

Features an interactive **Three.js building**, top-down floor plans, light/dark themes, JWT auth, and SQLite persistence.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts both:

- **API** at `http://localhost:3001`
- **Web** at `http://localhost:4200` (proxies `/api` → the API)

Both must be running — without the API, floors show “No rooms on this floor”.
